# Fifteen-Puzzle
An assignment from my web programming class CSE 154. This website is a game of fifteen puzzle where an image is splitted into 15 different pieces. The goal of the game is to get the user to be sort the pieces to get to the original picture. The entirety of the game function was written in Javascript.
